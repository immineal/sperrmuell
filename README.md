# Sperrmüll Bonn

A self-hosted, mobile-first map of Bonn's bulky-waste ("Sperrmüll")
collection: the exact streets and collection-zone polygons scheduled for
each date, built from bonnorange's official open data and OpenStreetMap
geometry.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm run data    # ETL: builds data/*.geojson + data/index.json
npm run dev     # starts the app (prints a Network URL — open that on your phone)
```

On first run, `npm run data` downloads the official CSV and Bonn's street/
address/Ortsteil geometry from OpenStreetMap (via Overpass) and caches
everything under `.cache/`. Subsequent runs reuse the cache and finish in a
few seconds.

For a production build:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Publishing

The app is served from `linu.li/tools/sperrmuell/`, out of the
[linu-li](https://github.com/immineal/linu-li) repository, which commits the
built output rather than building on deploy. Publishing is therefore a copy:

```sh
npm run build
npm run publish:site -- --dry   # what would change
npm run publish:site            # do it, then commit over there
```

`dist/` is a complete picture of the directory it feeds, so the copy is a
plain mirror with `--delete` and nothing to exclude. Two consequences worth
knowing:

- `base` lives in `app/vite.config.ts`, not on the command line. Build with
  the wrong one and every asset request goes to the domain root and 404s.
- The files that decide how the build is *served* live in `app/serve/` and are
  emitted into `dist/` by `servePlugin`: the two `.htaccess` rules (a year of
  cache for the content-hashed bundles, revalidation for the collection
  dates), and `abgemeldet-sw.js`.

That last one is the app's own history. Until September 2026 it answered at
`linu.li/sperrmuell/`, and everyone who opened it then still carries a service
worker registered from that address, which answers every request in the old
scope out of its cache. A worker script is never fetched through a redirect —
the browser reads that as a failed update and keeps what it has — so the old
address cannot simply 301 to the new one. It serves `abgemeldet-sw.js`
instead, whose only job is to take that registration apart.

Do not hand-edit anything under `tools/sperrmuell/` in the website's
repository. That is how the two last drifted: the service worker's cache
restriction was fixed there and never here, so the source kept the bug and the
next build would have shipped it straight back out. `test/serve.test.ts`
guards that one from this side now.

## What you'll see

- A map of Bonn with streets scheduled for the current date highlighted,
  color-coded per collection date.
- **Solid** lines = geometry matched exactly to OSM address data for that
  house-number range. **Dashed** lines = approximate (full street shown,
  reason given).
- A date scrubber (defaults to today/the next collection date) to step
  through the year's collection dates.
- Address search ("Straße Hausnummer") — jumps to the matching segment and
  shows its three collection dates for the year.
- Toggleable layers for collection-zone polygons and Ortsteil (district)
  boundaries.
- A "Datenqualität" panel (bottom sheet) with match-rate stats, the cluster
  validation badge, and source attribution.

## How it works

```
etl/          Node/TypeScript pipeline -> data/
app/          Vite + MapLibre GL frontend, reads data/
app/serve/    files that shape how the build is served, emitted into dist/
app/scripts/  publish.mjs — mirrors dist/ into the website's repository
data/         generated build artifacts (gitignored, recreate with `npm run data`)
```

The ETL pipeline (`npm run data`):

1. Parses bonnorange's "Abfuhrtermine 2026" CSV, filters to `PLAN_BEZ ===
   "Sperrmüll"`, and builds one segment per CSV row: street, Ortsteil, PLZ,
   a house-number predicate (even/odd ranges + `HNR_NEG` toggles), and its
   three collection dates.
2. Fetches Bonn's administrative boundary, `highway=*` ways, address
   nodes/ways, and Ortsteil (admin_level=10) polygons from OpenStreetMap via
   Overpass.
3. Matches each segment's street name to OSM ways (disambiguating by
   Ortsteil where the name occurs more than once in Bonn), then clips the
   way geometry to the segment's house-number range using the real
   `addr:housenumber` points.
4. Groups segments that share a date into per-date collection-zone polygons
   and validates that every segment contributes to exactly 3 zones (one per
   collection date).
5. Writes `data/segments.geojson`, `data/routes.geojson`,
   `data/ortsteile.geojson`, and `data/index.json` (build stats + validation
   report).

## Data quality

Every segment in `data/segments.geojson` has a `geometryConfidence`:

| Value         | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exact`       | Clipped to real OSM `addr:housenumber` points within the segment's range. |
| `approximate` | Full street geometry shown because no usable address data was found, or the street name is ambiguous across Bonn. The reason is in `confidenceNote`. |
| `unmatched`   | No OSM way found for this street name. `geometry` is `null`; listed in `data/index.json` under `unmatchedSegments` and not drawn on the map. |

`npm run data` exits non-zero if the overall match rate drops below 95%, the
exact-match rate drops below 75%, or the per-date route-cluster validation
fails (every segment must contribute to exactly 3 date clusters). The
current build matches ~99% of segments (~95% exact, ~4% approximate, <1%
unmatched) — see `data/index.json` for the latest numbers.

## Offline / restricted-network fallback

If `opendata.bonn.de` or `overpass-api.de` aren't reachable from your
environment:

- Download the CSV manually and run:
  ```sh
  npm run data:from-file -- /path/to/ABFUHRTERMINE2026OpenData.csv
  ```
- Once Overpass has succeeded once, its responses are cached under
  `.cache/osm/`, so later `npm run data` runs don't need network access to
  Overpass again.

## Testing

```sh
npm test
```

Runs the etl and app unit test suites (Vitest), covering CSV parsing (BOM,
German number/date formats, `HNR_NEG`, house-number ranges), street-name
normalization, predicate/containment logic, date filtering, address search,
and a matching/clipping test against a synthetic street — plus a real-data
check against the 15.06.2026 Röttgen/Ippendorf/Lengsdorf collection.
